# RandomColorSelector
A Color Selector app made in JavaScript with a bit of HTML and CSS styling. 
This was made following John Smilga's tutorial on the FreeCodeCamp youtube channel. 

#### The key concepts that I learnt about in this project were:
* arrays
* document.getElementById()
* document.querySelector()
* addEventListener()
* document.body.style.backgroundColor
* Math.floor()
* Math.random()
* array.length

I found this tutorial useful as it showed me house to use the addEventListener() command and the document.body.style.backgroundColor commands, which I have not used before.
